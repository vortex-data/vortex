# Random Access benchmark

Measures point-lookup latency: fetching individual rows by index from a file, rather than
scanning it. This is the workload behind the `Random Access` PR comment.

Two access patterns are generated with a fixed seed (see [`src/main.rs`](./src/main.rs)):

- **correlated**: several clusters of consecutive indices scattered across the dataset,
  simulating lookups with spatial locality;
- **uniform**: indices drawn from a Poisson process spread uniformly across the dataset,
  simulating lookups with no locality.

Each pattern runs over four datasets (`taxi`, `feature-vectors`, `nested-lists`,
`nested-structs`) in Parquet, Lance, and Vortex, both with a cached open file handle and
reopening the file per lookup. CI drives the full matrix via
[`scripts/random-access-split.py`](../../scripts/random-access-split.py).
