# JSONBench benchmark

[JSONBench](https://github.com/ClickHouse/JSONBench) is ClickHouse's benchmark for analytics
over semi-structured data: Bluesky firehose events, one JSON document per row. This suite
stores each document in a single Variant column, `data`, of the table `bluesky`, and runs
JSONBench's five queries. It is the main workload for the Vortex Variant type.

The harness lives in [`src/jsonbench`](../src/jsonbench).

## Data

`data-gen` downloads the gzipped NDJSON source files and parses them into Parquet files with a
[Parquet Variant](https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/master/VariantEncoding.md)
column. The Vortex files are converted from that Parquet, like every other suite, and hold the
column as a Vortex `Variant` in the Parquet Variant encoding.

Two options select the dataset:

- `--opt scale-factor=N`: the number of source files, each one million events. The default
  is 1, and JSONBench's own sizes are 1, 10, 100, and 1000.
- `--opt shredding=none|partial|query-fields`: which fields are
  [shredded](https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/master/VariantShredding.md) into
  typed columns. Fields that are not shredded stay in the binary Variant value.

| Shredding | Typed fields |
| --- | --- |
| `none` (default) | None |
| `partial` | `kind`, `did`, `time_us` |
| `query-fields` | The above plus `commit.collection`, `commit.operation` |

Every option value has its own data directory, `data/jsonbench/<N>m-<shredding>`. The source
files are shared, in `data/jsonbench/json`.

## Queries

Variant access has no SQL syntax that both engines accept, so each engine has its own file in
[`jsonbench/`](./jsonbench). The queries are numbered from Q0 in file order, and return the
same rows on both engines.

- [`datafusion.sql`](./jsonbench/datafusion.sql) calls `variant_get(data, path, type)`. This
  is the signature of [datafusion-variant](https://github.com/datafusion-contrib/datafusion-variant),
  which has no release for the DataFusion and Arrow versions Vortex builds against. Until it
  does, `datafusion-bench` registers its own function with that signature, on the same
  `parquet-variant-compute` kernel.
- [`duckdb.sql`](./jsonbench/duckdb.sql) uses DuckDB's native `VARIANT` type, with field
  access as `data.commit.collection::VARCHAR`.

## Engines and formats

| Engine | Parquet | Vortex | Vortex Compact | DuckDB |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DataFusion | yes | yes | yes | |
| DuckDB | yes | no | no | yes |

DuckDB cannot read the Vortex files yet: the Vortex DuckDB extension has no export from a
Vortex Variant to a DuckDB `VARIANT`. The `duckdb` format needs a `duckdb` CLI with the
`VARIANT` type (1.5 or later) on `PATH`.

DataFusion evaluates `variant_get` above the scan, because the Vortex scan does not push the
function down. For a shredded Vortex file, the scan therefore merges the typed fields back
into the binary Variant value before DataFusion reads it, which makes the shredded layouts
slower than `none` on Vortex.

## Running locally

```bash
vx-bench run jsonbench --engine datafusion --format parquet,vortex
vx-bench run jsonbench --engine datafusion --format parquet,vortex --opt shredding=query-fields
vx-bench run jsonbench --engine duckdb --format parquet,duckdb
```
