//! Drives a V2 scan for DataFusion.
//!
//! A planner says what it needs: compute, or reads. This driver decides where each runs. The
//! opener composes the planners over a [`PreparedScan`] and hands the driver the first; the
//! driver runs it and everything it emits on planning runs it owns: the root run stepped on
//! `spawn_cpu` tasks as the stream is polled, each spawned chunk on a task of its own, or on the
//! root run when the engine's partitions already fill the cores. Every read is a `spawn_io` task
//! of the file's segment source. The DataFusion thread polling the stream does no scan work
//! itself.
